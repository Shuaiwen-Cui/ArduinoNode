# INTEGRATED DEVELOPMENT ENVIRONMENT (IDE)

!!! note "Arduino Development Environment"
    Arduino development can be done in various ways, with the most common being the Arduino IDE. The Arduino IDE is an open-source integrated development environment specifically designed for Arduino hardware. It provides a simple and user-friendly interface that allows users to write, compile, and upload code to Arduino boards. In recent years, PlatformIO has also become a popular choice; it is a cross-platform IDE that supports multiple development boards and frameworks. PlatformIO offers more powerful features such as library management, debugging support, and various compiler options. PlatformIO is actually a plugin for VSCode, which is a powerful code editor that supports multiple programming languages and extensions. The VSCode plugin ecosystem is very rich, allowing users to enhance its functionality by installing different plugins. Given this, this project uses VSCode + PlatformIO as the primary development environment.
